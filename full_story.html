                <h1>The Summary of the Ramyana</h1>
                <p>
                    The Ramyana, one of the greatest epics in Indian literature, tells the divine story of Lord Ram, 
                    an avatar of Vishnu, and his journey of heroism, devotion, and righteousness. 
                    Below is the summary of the seven Kandas and the lessons learnt from each.

                    <h2>Bala Kanda</h2> 
                </div>
                
                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The Bala Kanda narrates the origins of Lord Ram and his three brothers: Lakshman, Bharat, and Shatrughna. King Dasharath of Ayodhya, who had three queens—Kausalya, Kaikeyi, and Sumitra—remained childless until performing a sacred fire ritual, the Putrakameshti Yagya. This led to the birth of the four princes, with Ram born to Kausalya, Bharat to Kaikeyi, and Lakshman and Shatrughna to Sumitra. The book details their upbringing, education in scriptures, and training in warfare. Notable events include Ram and Lakshman aiding Sage Vishwamitra by defeating demons that hindered his sacrifices. Ram, chosen by Vishwamitra, showed extraordinary valor at just 16 years old. The section also explores Sita’s divine origins—discovered in a field by King Janaka of Mithila—and her marriage to Ram, who proved his worth by lifting and stringing Lord Shiva’s bow. The Bala Kanda concludes with the weddings of Ram to Sita, Lakshman to Urmila, Bharat to Mandavi, and Shatrughna to Shrutakirti.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ram and his brothers are born through a divine ritual.</li>
                    <li>Ram and Lakshman accompany Vishwamitra to vanquish demons.</li>
                    <li>Ram wins Sita's hand by lifting Shiva's bow.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Lesson:</strong> The Bala Kanda emphasizes humility, duty, and respect for elders.</p>

                    <h2>Ayodhya Kanda</h2>
                </div>
                
                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The Ayodhya Kanda chronicles the events leading to Lord Ram's exile to the forest for fourteen years. After twelve years of marriage, King Dasharath decides to crown Ram as his successor, a choice celebrated by the citizens and the royal assembly. However, on the eve of Ram's coronation, Kaikeyi, influenced by her scheming maid Manthara, demands two boons previously promised by Dasharath: Ram's exile for fourteen years and the throne for her son Bharat. Bound by his word, Dasharath reluctantly agrees. Ram, embodying humility and obedience, accepts his fate with grace. Despite Ram’s initial refusal, Sita insists on accompanying him, displaying her unwavering love and devotion. Lakshman also chooses to join them in exile. Bharat, upon learning of the deceit, refuses the throne and instead places Ram's sandals on it, ruling on Ram's behalf until his return.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Dasharath plans Ram's coronation, but Kaikeyi intervenes.</li>
                    <li>Ram, Sita, and Lakshman leave for the forest.</li>
                    <li>Bharat declines the throne and rules in Ram's name.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Lesson:</strong> Loyalty, selflessness, and adherence to dharma are central themes.</p>

The most significant event is Sita's abduction by Ravana after she steps outside the protective Lakshman Rekha to aid a disguised Ravana. Taken to Lanka, Sita resists Ravana’s advances and remains steadfast in her devotion to Ram. Meanwhile, Ram and Lakshman, learning of her abduction from the dying vulture Jatayu, set out in pursuit. Along the way, they encounter Kabandha and Shabari, who guide them to Sugriva and Hanuman, marking the beginning of a powerful alliance.</p>

Ram and Lakshman meet Hanuman, Sugriva's loyal companion, who introduces them to Sugriva. Ram assists Sugriva by defeating his elder brother, Vali, enabling Sugriva to reclaim his throne. In return, Sugriva pledges to help Ram find Sita. Initially distracted from his promise, Sugriva is reminded by his wife Tara of his duty to Ram. Sugriva then dispatches search parties in all directions. The southern team, led by Hanuman and Angad, discovers from Sampati, a vulture, that Sita is imprisoned in Lanka.</p>

Demonstrating his immense strength and devotion, Hanuman transforms into a colossal form to leap across the ocean. Facing numerous challenges from demons testing his power, Hanuman overcomes every obstacle to reach Lanka and locate Sita. His arrival causes chaos as he destroys trees, buildings, and Ravana’s soldiers. Intentionally captured to speak with Ravana, Hanuman appeals for Sita's release, but Ravana refuses and orders Hanuman’s tail to be set ablaze. Using this to his advantage, Hanuman leaps across rooftops, setting Ravana’s citadel on fire. Victorious, he returns to Kishkindha with news of Sita’s location.</p>
