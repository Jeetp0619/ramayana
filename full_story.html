                <h1>The Summary of the Ramayana</h1>
                <p>
                    The Ramayana, one of the greatest epics in Indian literature, tells the divine story of Lord Ram, 
                    an avatar of Vishnu, and his journey of heroism, devotion, and righteousness. 
                    Below is the summary of the seven Kandas and the lessons learnt from each.

                    <h2>Bala Kanda</h2> 
                </div>
                
                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The Bala Kanda narrates the origins of Lord Rama and his three brothers: Lakshmana, Bharata, and Shatrughna. King Dasharatha of Ayodhya, who had three queens—Kausalya, Kaikeyi, and Sumitra—remained childless until performing a sacred fire ritual, the Putrakameshti Yagya. This led to the birth of the four princes, with Rama born to Kausalya, Bharata to Kaikeyi, and Lakshmana and Shatrughna to Sumitra. The book details their upbringing, education in scriptures, and training in warfare. Notable events include Rama and Lakshmana aiding Sage Vishwamitra by defeating demons that hindered his sacrifices. Rama, chosen by Vishwamitra, showed extraordinary valor at just 16 years old. The section also explores Sita’s divine origins—discovered in a field by King Janaka of Mithila—and her marriage to Rama, who proved his worth by lifting and stringing Lord Shiva’s bow. The Bala Kanda concludes with the weddings of Rama to Sita, Lakshmana to Urmila, Bharata to Mandavi, and Shatrughna to Shrutakirti.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Rama and his brothers are born through a divine ritual.</li>
                    <li>Rama and Lakshmana accompany Vishwamitra to vanquish demons.</li>
                    <li>Rama wins Sita's hand by lifting Shiva's bow.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Lesson:</strong> The Bala Kanda emphasizes humility, duty, and respect for elders.</p>

                    <h2>Ayodhya Kanda</h2>
                </div>
                
                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The Ayodhya Kanda chronicles the events leading to Lord Rama's exile to the forest for fourteen years. After twelve years of marriage, King Dasharatha decides to crown Rama as his successor, a choice celebrated by the citizens and the royal assembly. However, on the eve of Rama's coronation, Kaikeyi, influenced by her scheming maid Manthara, demands two boons previously promised by Dasharatha: Rama's exile for fourteen years and the throne for her son Bharata. Bound by his word, Dasharatha reluctantly agrees. Rama, embodying humility and obedience, accepts his fate with grace. Despite Rama’s initial refusal, Sita insists on accompanying him, displaying her unwavering love and devotion. Lakshmana also chooses to join them in exile. Bharata, upon learning of the deceit, refuses the throne and instead places Rama's sandals on it, ruling on Rama's behalf until his return.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Dasharatha plans Rama's coronation, but Kaikeyi intervenes.</li>
                    <li>Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana leave for the forest.</li>

                <p><strong>Lesson:</strong> Loyalty, selflessness, and adherence to dharma are central themes.</p>

The most significant event is Sita's abduction by Ravana after she steps outside the protective Lakshmana Rekha to aid a disguised Ravana. Taken to Lanka, Sita resists Ravana’s advances and remains steadfast in her devotion to Rama. Meanwhile, Rama and Lakshmana, learning of her abduction from the dying vulture Jatayu, set out in pursuit. Along the way, they encounter Kabandha and Shabari, who guide them to Sugriva and Hanuman, marking the beginning of a powerful alliance.</p>

Rama and Lakshmana meet Hanuman, Sugriva's loyal companion, who introduces them to Sugriva. Rama assists Sugriva by defeating his elder brother, Vali, enabling Sugriva to reclaim his throne. In return, Sugriva pledges to help Rama find Sita. Initially distracted from his promise, Sugriva is reminded by his wife Tara of his duty to Rama. Sugriva then dispatches search parties in all directions. The southern team, led by Hanuman and Angad, discovers from Sampati, a vulture, that Sita is imprisoned in Lanka.</p>

Demonstrating his immense strength and devotion, Hanuman transforms into a colossal form to leap across the ocean. Facing numerous challenges from demons testing his power, Hanuman overcomes every obstacle to reach Lanka and locate Sita. His arrival causes chaos as he destroys trees, buildings, and Ravana’s soldiers. Intentionally captured to speak with Ravana, Hanuman appeals for Sita's release, but Ravana refuses and orders Hanuman’s tail to be set ablaze.
